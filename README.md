## ‚úàÔ∏è Direct & 1-Stop Flight Route Finder: New York ‚Üî Tokyo
### üì¶ Overview

This project demonstrates, with SQL, how to efficiently identify **all possible airline routes between New York and Tokyo** using flight and airport data. The solution covers both **direct flights** and **one-stop connections** (at most one layover), and calculates the total journey duration for each route.  
It‚Äôs a practical scenario to showcase SQL skills in querying, joining, and handling real-world travel data.

### üöÄ Problem Statement

Given two tables:

- **airports**: airport codes and city names.
- **flights1**: flight ID, start/end airport codes, and scheduled departure/arrival times.

**Objective:**  
List all valid flight routes from New York to Tokyo including:
- Direct flights (no layover)
- 1-stop connecting flights (at most one layover; layover arrival ‚â§ next departure)

For every route, show:
- The flight segment(s) (IDs)
- Origin city (`start_city`)
- Layover (`middle_city` if any)
- Destination (`end_city`)
- Total trip duration in minutes

### üéØ Sample Output

| flight_id | start_city | middle_city   | end_city | duration (minutes) |
|-----------|------------|---------------|----------|--------------------|
| 1         | New York   |               | Tokyo    | 720                |
| 2,3       | New York   | Los Angeles   | Tokyo    | 900                |
| 4,9       | New York   | Los Angeles   | Tokyo    | 900                |
| 2,9       | New York   | Los Angeles   | Tokyo    | 900                |

- For direct flights, `middle_city` is blank.
- For 1-stop flights, `middle_city` is the layover city.
- `duration` is the total elapsed time for the trip.

### ü¶æ Approach

1. **Expand flights with city names** using joins to `airports` for both start and end ports.
2. **Direct routes:** Find flights with `start_city = 'New York'` and `end_city = 'Tokyo'`.
3. **1-stop routes:** Self-join flights via a common `end_port`/`start_port`, ensuring `a.end_time <= b.start_time`.
4. **Output:** Combine both via `UNION`, presenting direct and 1-stop routes with IDs, city labels, and duration in minutes.

### ü§î Notes

- Easily generalizes to other origin-destination pairs by changing city filters.
- Can incorporate further filters, such as minimum or maximum layover duration.
- Demonstrates best practices for SQL querying, including joins, self-joins, unions, and date/time calculations.
- Useful for interview preparation, data analysis, and real-world airline itinerary scenarios.
